# Ideabox Group Project

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building an application a new client that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript and to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and `localStorage` to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.  Our goal is to also incorporate an agile workflow by incorporating two weekly sprints.

*Note*: Expectations listed for Iteration 0-1 should be complete by your first check-in. No JavaScript should be written before that check-in, unless you get approval to move ahead with functionality from your Project Manager.

# Functionality

Mobile Layout (Media specs here i. e. 400px)
*Screenshots/giphs needed*

* When user is within the media specifications they should have a "hamburger menu" icon in the upper left containing the Filter for starred ideas with a button. Below that There is a Title and Body for the user to input their ideas, and a save button to save. Under that there is a "search ideas" bar which should allow the user to search through their idea cards. Below this main box, the user should see container full of their idea boxes. This comes complete with a clickable star to mark highly valued cards, or an 'x' button for un-valued cards. The main section of the card should display to the user their saved title and body text, and under that there is a comment section for the user to input various comments on their cards.


# Learning Goals

* Build stronger CSS and HTML skills and strategies.
* Continue to improve on building responsive client-side applications with good user feedback
* Understand how to implement client-side data persistence using `localStorage`
* Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
* Utilize `data-*` attributes
* Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
